# Portfolio of Olga Zhdanova
QA & Application Support Analyst transitioning into Business Analysis

I'm an experienced QA and Application Support Analyst focused on ensuring product quality and delivering effective resolutions to user and business issues.
Currently, I’m expanding my expertise into Business and Data Analysis, combining an analytical mindset with a deep understanding of processes and user needs.

This portfolio presents QA and analytical artifacts that reflect both my previous professional experience and my current transition into analytical roles.
Each section includes self-created materials demonstrating analytical thinking, problem-solving, and attention to product quality.
